# FocusLoom Chrome Listing Assets

## Short Description (Up to 132 Characters)

“Modern new-tab dashboard with customizable backgrounds, search, weather, todo, and Pomodoro widgets—all stored locally.”

## Full Description

FocusLoom replaces your browser’s new tab with a distraction-free control center. Personalize your wallpaper, greeting, and typography, then organize your day with the built-in search hub, weather widget, todo list, and Pomodoro timer. All settings stay on your device—nothing is synced or uploaded unless you choose to export them.

**Features**

- Custom backgrounds and text color presets.
- Multi-engine search bar with inline suggestions.
- Weather, todo, and Pomodoro widgets that can be toggled individually.
- Timezone-aware clock and greeting.
- Local persistence with optional export/import (coming soon).
- Optimized both for large displays and compact laptop layouts.

**Privacy**

FocusLoom stores personal data (name, todos, city, API key) locally in your browser. The extension only contacts:

- `https://api.openweathermap.org` (weather data when you provide an API key).
- `https://duckduckgo.com` (search suggestions). Future updates will remove the proxy to avoid third-party relays.

## Screenshots Needed

Chrome Web Store requires at least one 1280×800 screenshot. Suggested set:

1. Default dashboard with greeting/search/weather/todo/Pomodoro visible.
2. Settings panel open showing background picker.
3. Compact mode (narrow window, showing collapsed widgets).

Store them as `store/screenshots/dashboard-1.png`, etc., once captured.

- 16×16, 32×32, 48×48, 128×128 PNGs (already referenced in manifest; ensure they are square and crisp).
- Optional 256×256 promotional icon for listing page.
