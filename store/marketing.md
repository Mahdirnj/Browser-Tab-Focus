# FocusLoom Chrome Listing Assets

## Short Description

"Modern new-tab dashboard with customizable backgrounds, search, weather, todo, and Pomodoro widgets -- all stored locally."

## Full Description

FocusLoom replaces your browser's new tab with a distraction-free control center. Personalize wallpaper, greeting, and typography, then organize your day with the built-in search hub, weather widget, todo list, and Pomodoro timer. Everything stays on your device; nothing is synced or uploaded unless you export it.

### Feature Highlights

- Custom backgrounds and text-color presets.
- Multi-engine search bar with inline suggestions.
- Weather, todo, and Pomodoro widgets that can be toggled individually.
- Timezone-aware clock and greeting.
- Local persistence with optional export/import (coming soon).
- Responsive layout for both large displays and compact laptops.

### Privacy Snapshot

FocusLoom stores personal data (name, todos, city, API key) locally in the browser. The extension only contacts:

- `https://api.openweathermap.org` - weather data (when the user supplies an API key).
- `https://duckduckgo.com` - search suggestions (currently via the existing proxy; long-term plan is a self-hosted endpoint).

## Screenshots Needed

Chrome Web Store requires at least one 1280 x 800 screenshot. Suggested set:

1. Default dashboard showing greeting/search/weather/todo/Pomodoro.
2. Settings panel open with the background picker visible.
3. Compact/narrow layout to demonstrate responsiveness.

Store the captures under `store/screenshots/` (for example, `dashboard-1.png`).

## Icon Checklist

- 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 PNGs (already referenced in the manifest; verify they are crisp).
