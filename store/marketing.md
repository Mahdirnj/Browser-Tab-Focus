# FocusLoom Chrome Listing Assets

## Short Description (<=132 characters)

"Modern new-tab dashboard with customizable backgrounds, search, weather, todo, and Pomodoro widgets — all stored locally."

## Full Description

FocusLoom replaces your browser's new-tab page with a distraction-free control center. Personalize the wallpaper, greeting, and typography, then organize your day with the built-in search hub, weather widget, todo list, and Pomodoro timer. All data stays on your device; nothing is synced or uploaded unless you export it manually.

### Feature Highlights

- Custom backgrounds and text-color presets.
- Multi-engine search bar with inline suggestions.
- Weather, todo, and Pomodoro widgets that can be toggled individually.
- Timezone-aware clock and greeting.
- Local persistence with optional export/import (coming soon).
- Responsive layout for both wide monitors and compact laptops.

### Privacy Snapshot

Data stored locally: name, timezone, widget preferences, todos, Pomodoro state, weather city, and the user's OpenWeather API key (if provided).

Remote calls:

- `https://api.openweathermap.org` — live weather data (requires the user's API key).
- `https://duckduckgo.com` — search suggestions (currently via the existing proxy; a self-hosted alternative is planned).
